# Oregon Trail 

https://gamedevacademy.org/js13kgames-tutorial/
  
Game from the tutorial based on Oregon Trail

The project is presented with Repls covering all of the base knowledge
Loops functions conditionals classes etc. Challenges ask students to 
modify and improve on the starter project, while stretch challenges 
give students who already have the base knowledge something to work on.

## Challenges 

1) Get the tutorial working 
2) Play the game
  - Play the game a few times. 
  - Get into it
  - Have fun
  - Get to oregon!
  - Fight the bandits
  - Run away from the bandits
  - Ox Flu Sucks!
3) Check for errors.
  - Check for any errors you might find
  - Play test and make sure all of the features in the game are working. 
4) Add some styles 
  - Use your CSS skills to improve the look of the game. 
5) Update the code to more modern and easier to understand syntax
  - Replace var with let, and const
  - Object deconstruction
6) OOP - Define class Objects for Caravan, Event, Game, and UI
7) Make a class to represent the stat box. 
   - Better to have an object that represents this element and it's 
   children. Have this be a dependency of UI
8) Make a class for the Fight box
   - Better to have this be an object that is a dependency of the
   UI class. 
9) Make a class to represent the Shop box
   - Better as it's own class dependency of UI
10) Make a class to represent the status/history box thing.
   - Yeah it's better as a class. 
11) Could this use the MVC architecture? What about MVVM?
  - The data classes like Caravan, EventType, and Product represent Model Data
  - Classes like Game and UI represent controllers. 
  - DOM elements, and or a class that holds them represent a view. 
12) Look at the Numbers
  - Examine the numbers and the probablities. 
  - Play with the numbers make changes and play test
  - 
13) Display a game over screen that summarizes the game that just completed. Show:
  - Number of mniles covered 
  - The number of days traveled
  - The number of crew to survive the trip
  - Number of oxen to make the trip
  - Stretch goals 
    - the number of Bandit attacks 
    - the number of crew killed
    - the number of oxen lost on route
    - the units of food eaten
